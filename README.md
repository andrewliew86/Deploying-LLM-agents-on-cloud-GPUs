# Creating an open-source AI-powered agent using LangChain and HuggingFace

Agents are large language models that are equipped with tools (e.g. search engines, Python REPL etcâ€¦) so it is no longer limited by itâ€™s training data. The agent takes a task as input, breaks it into a set of smaller tasks and then uses the tools at itâ€™s disposable to complete these tasks. 

We will be creating a basic agent in Langchain using an open-source language model from Hugging Face that can automatically look for webpages (DuckDuckGo search) and YouTube videos (YouTube search) based on a query.
